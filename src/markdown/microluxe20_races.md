# Introduction
This is an introduction to the most predominant races of Terador. There are other races and animals native to Terador, but those other races play a significantly smaller role.

## Humans

**Leader:** The Queen of Roses (Queen Thalassa)

**Capital:** Garrant

**Info:** The Humans are currently led by Queen Thalassa, a mysterious Queen who has recently been conveniently absent amid one of the greatest plagues ever to exist in all of Terador. Her military, The Knights of the Rose, have restricted all sighting and meetings with her, making it nearly impossible to speak with the Queen. These knights keep control throughout the kingdom ruling the land with an iron fist. The land to the northeast of Garrant has begun to die, granting it the name "The Deadlands". While the reason for the decay is unknown, it has caused hard times for the kingdom, bringing forth a plague of evil and rot. Many Humans have requested to speak with the queen on the matter, but to no avail. The Knights of the Rose are steadfast in restricting any access to the Queen. Recently, the semi-tyrannical decisions of the once noble Knights of the Rose have caused century old alliances with the Elves and Dwarves to wane and fall apart.

## Great Elves

**Leader:** Maerun

**Capital:** Aelbrynn

**Info:** The Great Elves, said to be extremely tall, taking pride in the length of their ears, mostly stay amongst themselves. Outside of their own culture (and the Forged), few know about the inner workings of their society. They live on a secluded island off of the northeastern coast of Terador, although they have scattered settlements among the northern parts of the deserts on the mainland. Aside from the traders that travel to and from the island, as well as mages seeking an arcane pilgrimage, no one really interacts with the Great Elves. However, thanks to the trade business of the Mir, it is widely known that the Great Elves are great magical beings and possess some of the most powerful arcane power in the world. They are also known for crafting some of the greatest items, weapons, and machinery in the world.

## Forest Elves

**Leader:** Amaladrys

**Capital:** Deepwood

**Info:** Forest Elves (also commonly called Wood Elves, or Green Elves) are the most commonly seen Elves. They live in the forests of western Terador. Their neighbors include the Gori, to the south (friendly) and the Orcs, to the north (sworn enemies). They are known for their speed and dexterity. They are also very attuned to the forest and the creatures within it. Due to their constant war with the Orcs, they have vigorous military training regardless of gender, starting from a young age. Most Forest Elves live as hunters and gatherers, traveling in hunting parties throughout the forests surrounding Deepwood, their stationary capital. They are widely accepted as the best marksmen and trackers in all of Terador.

## Halflings and Gnomes (Gori)

**Leader:** Hollander Gerywether

**Capitals:** Cimarron and Edenmoore

**Info:** The Halflings and Gnomes have shared the same land for centuries. Their cultures have become so intertwined that they've become one and the same. Calling themselves the "Gori", they live in the southwestern hills of Terador. They are closely allied with the Wood Elves to the north and Dwarves in the mountains to the east. The Gori are well known for their culture revolving around the farming seasons and food production. Almost all crops in Terador originate from either the farms of the Gori or the Human farms. With the current "Deadlands" problem, almost all crops have been coming from the famous Gori farms. Some Gori are peaceful and homey, whereas others are known for being cunning thieves. Even still, many work hard to learn the secrets of the arcane, and thus Cimarron has recently become one of the largest magical capitals of Terador. Edenmoore, on the other hand, is much more of a trade center, hosting most of the crops and goods of the region, until it is time for the goods to be shipped around the world.

## Forged

**Leader:** The Great One

**Capital:** Babel

**Info:** The Forged are a mechanical species that live in the northern deserts of Terador. While completely sentient and able to live alone, they usually work together as a hive mind, creating wondrous cities in the sand. They can sense each other from up to a mile (1.5 km.) away, and can speak to one another without making a sound (although their telepathic speech is limited to their own race). As some travelers have found through conversation, the Forged claim to follow what they call a "higher calling". They claim that their lives are devoted to "The Great One", although they do not reveal who or what "The Great One" is, or why they are devoted to it. Their origin is also a mystery, and their methods of growth in population are unknown. The Forged are a peaceful race and often travel through the mountains to trade with the Lycanthropes and Humans. Because of their mechanical bodies, they are seemingly impervious to many physical ailments that plague Human travelers who try to pass through the dangerous Spinecrest Mountains that border the northern desert and Garrant.

## Dwarves

**Leaders:** Tane, Braden, Galvan

**Capital:** CinderHal

**Info:** The Dwarves are known for 3 specific things in Terador: escorts-for-hire, blacksmiths/forgers, and inventors. Each aspect of Dwarven culture is run by one of the three leaders of the Dwarven people. Braden is a young Dwarf that has recently become the new leader of the mercenary branch of CinderHal, the Dwarves' main capital. Under his rule, the Dwarves have gained an even larger presence outside of their traditional mountain borders. Dwarves are now a more common sight to behold in Terador thanks to Braden's rule. Tane, the old and wise, is the oldest of the three leaders, taking ownership of the inventors of CinderHal. With his wit and technical prowess, Dwarves have begun to create new mechanical and magical devices that have begun to outmatch even the Great Elves' inventions. Galvan, clever and resourceful albeit slightly brash, is the leader of the great forges of CinderHal. He rallies all of the smiths of the Dwarven race, helping craft some of the greatest weaponry ad armor in all of Terador. With the help of the Half-men's trading, Dwarven-crafted armor is becoming a highly profitable business, bringing in a new golden age for the Dwarves.

## Minotaurs

**Leaders:** Rygar Windblade and Ovenharn Earthgore

**Capital:** The Blood City

**Info:** Minotaurs are a hardy race that live on two isles to the north of Terador. They are constantly at war with themselves and other races. Both islands host two different factions, each vying for control over their beloved capital, The Blood City. Elections are unheard of in their government. Instead, a new leader is decided every 5 years by challenging opponents to a battle to the death in the "Great Blood Arena". The challenges begin on the first full moon, lasting throughout the night. The last man alive in the arena is deemed the new leader of The Blood City. For the last arena competition, two minotaurs remained at the end of the night: Rygar of the Windblades, and Ovenharn of the Earthgores. Putting their heritage and differences aside, Rygar and Ovenharn refused to kill one another, deciding to unite instead. In an attempt to bring the Minotaur people together, both have been deemed leaders of The Blood City. So far, things seem to be successful. Apart from the occasional riots and brawls, the minotaurs have seemingly banded together to fight a common enemy: the Orcs and Goblins of the mainland, who threaten to take over their island homes. Only time will tell if the Minotaurs will be able to maintain their new alliances.

## Lycanthropes (Were-men)

**Leader:** 4 small clans ( Halifen of the Sun Whisperers,  Jacen of the Moonbearers, Karien of the Starlacers, Avadar of the Dawnbringers)

**Capital:** none

**Info:** Each clan orients around the times of day that they are primarily human. Each clan morphs between human and wolf on a daily basis. The wolf form is anthropomorphic, but it can still run on all fours. These clans, unlike traditional folklore, are an accepted race and are not outcast compared to other major races. As a wolf, they still interact in a more human-like manner and can understand human speech. However unlike humanity, even in their human form, they are entirely carnivorous and have much sharper teeth and grow claws instead of fingernails. Younger Lycanthropes cannot control their morphing and their bodies morph only according to their clan's morphology. The older a Lycanthrope gets, the more control they gain over their bodies. That being said, when under attack or threatened, Lycanthropes can typically morph at will.

The following are the clans and their respective ways of life:

Sun Whisperers are the were-men who are most human-like. They seem human while the sun is out (approx. 8 a.m. - 8 p.m.) and only morph to wolves when the sun goes down. Typically they sleep through the night when in wolf form, since they favor their human-like bodies more. Their society is typically embarrassed of their morphology and view their wolf-form as a curse. They try to mimic Humanity and are almost indiscernible from Humans aside for their nails and teeth, which are pointed and sharp.

Moonbearers are not on speaking terms with the Sun Whisperers. Completely opposing the Sun Whisperers, Moonbearers are only human when the moon is up (approx. 8 p.m. - 8 a.m.). During the day they are typically in their wolf-like form. Because of this, they are the most feral of the clans. They typically dislike the human side of themselves and many try to master morphing so that they can perpetually be wolves. Their society revolves around the man that can best master his Lycanthropic form.

Starlacers and Dawnbringers are both fairly synonymous. Although they both have official clan leaders and only follow that leader's ways, they live together and share the same land. Their leaders are very close friends who agree wholeheartedly on how both of their clans should interact. Starlacers only take wolf-form as the sun sets (approx 12 p.m. - 12 a.m.), and the Dawnbringers only take wolf-form as the sun rises (approx 12 a.m. - 12 p.m.. Because of their differing times, There is always a mix of wolf and human embodiments except for brief moments around mid-day and midnight. They are not afraid of either form they take and embrace both aspects of themselves. They are seemingly the purest form of Lycanthropes, since they truly live their lives as both man and wolf with no desire to suppress one of their forms.

## Goblins

**Leader:** Goblin King (Ugdok)

**Capital:** Uk

**Info:** Goblins are small, pestilent, and obnoxious. They're an aggressive carnivorous race that travel the realm in search of "shiny"(gold, silver, etc.) and "grub" (anything that lives and moves that they can kill and eat). Their homeland is far north, but they can be found just about everywhere, because of the extensive caves and caverns that they have created underneath Terador. They are naturally cave-dwelling creatures and only come out of the ground when they are hungry or find something intriguing. They are typically dimwitted, although some can learn arcane spells and even master other skills. They cannot see very well in the light and almost always attack at night or in caves. Although the Goblins officially have a leader (simply called the Goblin King), he does not have the power to oversee all Goblins. In reality, he only controls the Goblins near the official Goblin capital, Uk.

## Giants

**Leader:** Kairem (a golden dragon)

**Capital:** Skala

**Info:** The Giants are a mysterious and simple folk. Because of their brief appearances outside of the Spinecrst Mountains (their home), some believe they are nothing but a fairy tale. Others claim that they eat people. Regardless of the rumors, it is certain that they live throughout the Spinecrest Mountains, in the extreme heights and cold, where its almost entirely uninhabitable for the other races of Terador. They are the oldest race of Terador, and being so,  have the closest ties to the Titans and dragons of Terador. They are almost always in contact with the Titans and remaining dragons of the realm. They live a solemn lifestyle and harvest energy from the Mountain's core to keep warm in the bitter conditions. Skala is rumored to be a wondrous gigantic city built into the molten core of the highest peak in the Spinecrest Mountains.

## Orcs

**Leader:** The Den Mother

**Capital:** Grulgar

**Info:** Orcs are a bizarre race. Some claim they are insect in nature; some claim they are plants; others claim they are just like Humans. In reality, they possess traits similar to all three. Similar to ants and other colony insects, Orcs reproduce through den mothers. The den mother, who is replaced over time, is the main source of Orcs. She spawns multitudes of Orcs on a daily basis. The Orcs, as a race, are on a quest to "better their bloodline". To do so, they constantly fight other races to the death, ensuring only the strongest Orcs survive. These surviving Orcs will then return to the den mother and donate their genes to her. Their donations make the Den Mother's next set of spawns genetically similar to the Orc that donated his genes. Similar to plants, Orcs have developed to where they can regrow body parts over time. If an arm is lost, an Orc can regrow the arm over the course of a few days. It has been said that some of the most powerful Orcs can regenerate limbs in less than a day. Most Orcs that people see are male, because the males are the only Orcs that go out to better the bloodline. Females typically stay near the capital,  helping with spawning and competing to become the next den mother. Although Orcs are typically born through spawning, Orcs still possess the ability to reproduce like Humans do. They are also physically similar to Humans, albeit larger and stronger. They also have tusks, which are a source of masculine pride. The larger the tusk, the manlier the Orc. The Orcs are typically violent in nature and work hard to take control of all of Terador, attempting to create the most powerful race in existence.

## Mir (also called Half-men, consisting of Dwarmir, Elvir, Orkeir, Tauremir, and Gorimir)

**Leader:** Orowyn the Trader

**Capital:** Pelgiar

**Info:**"Half-men" is a blanket term, referring to many different half-breed races that have joined together to create their own society. They comprise of the following:

Dwarmir – Half Dwarf and half another race.

Elvir – Half Elf and half another race.

Orkeir- Half Orc and half another race.

Taurmir – Half Minotaur and half another race.

Gorimir – Half Gori and half another race.

The Half-men are ruled by Orowyn, who was voted into place by all of the citizens of Pelgiar. Orowyn is a well known Elvir, who has devoted his life to growing Pelgiar into the trade capital of Terador. So far, under his rule, the Half-men have become known as Terador's greatest traders. They live in the swamps and coasts of southern Terador, and are well known for their trade-ships that travel the world. While some are pirates and thieves, most are traders, buying and selling goods from all over Terador. Many call the Half-men "Middle-men" because of both their physical appearances and their role in Terador's market. Half-men are not considered half-breeds or lower life forms. Instead, they are very common sights in Terador and widely accepted. Some races (particularly the Orcs) have a slight disdain for some breeds of Half-men, but for the most part, their race is not looked down upon. Recently, Orowyn has been meeting with the Dwarves, working on a new project that will hopefully usher in a revolution in transportation and trade throughout Terador.

## Slaan

**Leader:** Syss-tok

**Capital:** Armagand

**Info:** The Slaan are anthropomorphic reptilian men. They are an intelligent and mostly peaceful race (although they have had bouts with the Dwarves and Humans over land-boundaries before), known for their progressive medicines and mysticism. Similar to the Forest Elves, they are very attuned to the nature around them. After a recent incident involving the poisoning and murder of the previous High King, the Captain of the Guard, Syss-tok, has taken over leadership. While this would typically cause an uproar, Syss-tok is extremely well liked by the general populace, so his coup has gone unquestioned. Under Syss-tok's rule so far, Armagand has continued to be the center for Terador's medicine and poisons. Slannri alchemists and mystics are hired throughout the continent for help tending to the sick or wounded.
