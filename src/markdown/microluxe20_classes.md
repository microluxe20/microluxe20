# Classes, Spells, and Powers

The following spells and powers have been customized and tweaked to make the game as smooth as possible. It is suggested to use these spells for all spell casters in the game, although spells from the SRD can also be used in Microluxe20 with slight modifications. With the following spell system in place, additional spells in the SRD (but not on this list) can easily be discovered in the game as loot, research, etc. if the GM desires.

Each class has a brief description, a list of their abilities and the minimum level for each ability, and a list of spells that class can cast divided by caster level.

## Fighter

Fighters are mercenaries, brawlers, muscle-for-hire, wrestlers, dockworkers, or members of any other profession that require strength and skill in equal measure.

**Equipment**: Fighters can use all types of weapon, armor, and shields.

**Weapon Proficiency**: Fighters gain +1 to all attack and damage rolls. This increases by +1 at 5th level and every five levels onward.

**Extremely Healthy**: Each time they level up, Fighters gain HP equal to their STR bonus in addition to the normal HP gained when leveling up.

**Cleave** (lv 5): If a Fighter's melee attack downs or slays a foe, the figher may make one additional melee attack against another target within melee range. This ability can compound, meaning if one swing kills the second foe, the Fighter can make a third attack, and so on.

## Rogue

A Rogue is a master of the urban sprawl, attacking from the shadows and fading away without a trace. Whether aristocrat or commoner, a Rogue is equally at home in a tavern as they are in a high-society function, picking pockets and poisoning drinks just as easily as starting a bar brawl or thanking a noble for his hospitality.

**Equipment**: Rogues can use light armor, can use bucklers, and can use simple weapons and complex light weapons.

**Sneak Attack**: With a successful sneak check (usually Guile+DEX), Rogues add their Guile skill to the damage of their first attack that turn. Sub-attacks and additional attacks that turn do not receive a _Sneak Attack_ bonus.

**Evade** (lv 5): Any save that a Rogue succeeds cannot deal damage to the rogue. For example, some spells or abilities deal half-damage even if the target saves successfully. With Evade, the Rogue would not take any damage as long as he/she saved successfully.

## Mage

Mages are perhaps the simplest of spellcasters, working their craft of science and knowledge to channel the energies of the Astral Plane into complex productions of magic. Mages were the first to pioneer the Runic alphabet and tongue, in which scrolls are written and spells are cast.

**Equipment**: Mages wear no armor, cannot use shields, and can only use simple weapons.

**Detect Magic:** Detects spells and magic items within 60 ft. at will. A roll may be required to detect magic that is actively being hidden.

## Illusionist

Illusionists focus their arcane power into creating phantasms of will and tricking others into believing their specific version of the world.

## Druid

Druids tend to be reclusive hermits, eschewing the busy life of towns and cities for the simple life of the forests and plains, gaining their powers from their worship of nature deities.

Druids must forgo the use of weapons and armor made of metal worked by mortal hands. Simple baubles and tools with small amounts of metal are not enough to draw their deity's ire, but like Clerics, Druids must spend time returning to the good graces of their deity if they stray.

## Bard

Entertainers, scoundrels, sages, tricksters, historians, and bartenders all in one, Bards use their musical talent and their ability to make light of outrageous actions to great effect. Where a Rogue is the knife in the shadows, a Bard is a torch, shining so brightly they evade the suspicion of wrongdoing entirely.

**Equipment**: Bards wear light armor, can use bucklers, and can use simple weapons and complex light weapons. They typically carry at least one type of musical instrument, and are skilled at many different types of performances.

**Musical Performance**: With a successful skill check, cancels or counters sound-based effects within 30 ft.

**Charm Person**: Whether by music, dance, or a speech, a Bard can attempt to influence a person by making a performance roll (STR, DEX, or MIND + Communication). The effects of _Charm Person_ are determined by the GM.

**Remove Fear**: As with _Charm Person_, a Bard can encourage and rally a group of people with a performance roll (vs a GM-set DC). A successful roll counters fear-based effects and grants all targets +1 to MIND saves for 1 hr / level.

**Amateur Magician** (lv 6): A Bard may cast spells as if they were either an Illusionist or Druid of 5 levels below their own. The choice of spellcasting class is permanent and cannot be changed.

## Psion

Psions are strange quirks of nature whose minds are warped from birth. They posess a natural connection with the Ethereal Plane, which allows them to directly project power into their surroundings. This often results in Psions perceiving the world in strange ways, and developing anti-social and amoral tendencies due to their outcast status.

Psions cannot not use staves, rods, or metamagic. Instead, their powers are augmented with additional Hit Points (HP). The augmenting HP cost is noted under each power's entry. The combined HP cost for manifesting and augmenting a power (disregarding signature spell bonus) cannot exceed the character's psionic class level. Thus, a 3rd level psion could manifest a level 2 power by spending 2 HP, and augment it with at most 1 additional HP for a total HP cost of 3.

_Psionic vs. Magical Effects_: Powers interact with spells and spells interact with powers in the same way a spell or normal spell-like ability interacts with another spell or spell-like ability. For example, detect magic detects psionics and dispel psionics dispels magic.

**Equipment**: Psions can use light armor, can not use shields, and can only use simple weapons.
