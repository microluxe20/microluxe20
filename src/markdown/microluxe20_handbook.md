# Introduction

Microluxe20 is a minimalist tabletop role-playing game designed with simplicity in mind. Using an easy-to-grasp, yet extremely robust framework, Microluxe20 allows for crafting exciting encounters that are fun and fluid, emphasizing storytelling and player interaction over the traditional "straight-jacket" skill systems found in many modern tabletop games.

Keeping compatibility in mind, OGL/d20 supplements should work out of the box, without any conversions; in fact, SRD/OGL adventures with any incompatibilities can be converted _on the fly_ with almost no effort! The entire character sheet fits on one sheet of paper, meaning character creation and management is extremely quick and easy.

Microluxe20 is great for one-shot adventures, or teaching new players about tabletop gaming. However, unlike many one-shot styled tabletop games, it is also robust enough to cater to full-fledged campaign-style games as well, especially because of its compatibility with other OGL/d20 content.

### What is a Role-Playing Game?

A role-playing game (RPG) is a cooperative narration game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting, deciding freely which actions to take as their fictional alter-ego. The Game Master(GM), the main narrator of the game, describes the game world and its inhabitants. The other players describe the intended actions of their characters, and the GM describes the outcomes. Actions taken within the game succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. For example:

**GM:** “You’re walking along a path in a small wood when you hear noises coming from behind a large bush of vegetation. A sparkle of light reveals something shiny...”

**Now it’s your turn:** Are you a fearful adventurer that decides to run for his life? Are you brave enough to search in the wood? Maybe you’re a warrior that grabs his sword, sure that this is an ambush. Or maybe you’re a smart and cunning rogue, climbing silently on a tree to look at what’s behind the plants. Maybe you’re a powerful wizard that casts a spell to clearly see through all obstacles in front of you. The possibilities are limitless! It’s up to you to decide!

### Items Needed

To play Microluxe20, you will need **paper**, **pencils**, and a conventional set of **d20 tabletop dice**. The dice required to play are a 4-sided die (d4), 6-sided die (d6), 8-sided die (d8), 10-sided die (d10), 12-sided die (d12), 20-sided die (d20), and a Percentile 10-sided die (d10 showing 00/10/20/30, etc).

When referencing dice in the game, dice rolls are often abbreviated to something like "d6" or "d20", where the number after the "d" represents the number of sides on the die. Numbers in front of the "d" dictate how many times the die should be rolled.

For example, “3d6 + 5” means you roll three 6-sided dice, add their results together, then add 5 to the total.

While Microluxe20 does not require miniatures or tokens of any kind, having a handful of counters or markers on hand can help the Gamemaster describe the setup and positioning of the various encounters players will face.

### Getting Started

Microluxe20 can be played with as many people as the Gamemaster can handle, but 4 to 6 players is considered to be the optimal number. A table for all participants to sit at is recommended; players will be able to more easily roll dice and write on their character sheets.

The Gamemaster and players should sit down and agree on a set of rules governing table conduct before starting play; this can be as simple as "no shouting over each other", or as complex and innovative as necessary.

Once this is settled, the Gamemaster begins to describe the adventure, and the players create their characters.

# Character Creation

Creating a character in Microluxe20 is simple. You start by choosing a name and race, and build a story and physical description around those choices. Your character's class determines your starting skills, and you'll assign your stats to finish the process.

Choosing the name is one of the most difficult parts of the process; talk with your Gamemaster about what is thematically appropriate for the setting and your race, and see if they have any suggestions if you are stuck. Choose wisely, for once you have decided on a name, it is nigh impossible to disassociate it from the character.

## Races

Your character's race determines your overall physical appearance and provides different bonuses to stats and skills.

When creating a character, your player will be one of the major races of Terador. The world has a wealth of races to choose from, each with their unique history. While the Mir are the most common race in Terador, the many other races are fairly commonplace to see as well.

<!-- $data races.yml races t-full -->

Once you have a name and race, you will need to decide on the physical attributes of your character. This includes things like eye color, hair color and length, the build of your character, whether they have any distinctive scars or markings, and similar attributes. A good physical description should be fairly short, but enough to identify your character even in a room full of people.

## Vices and Virtues

When creating a character to roleplay, designing a backstory and personality is highly recommended to help flesh out the narrative and provide a reference point for your portrayal of that character. An easy way to start is to pick a vice (a weakness or failing of some sort), a virtue (something your character is good at), and a need or desire.

These can be anything you would want to roleplay - the character might be proficient with whips, have a crippling fear of snakes, and desire to find hidden treasures; or your character might have an anger issue with the town guard and just wants to be left alone to have a drink. The most interesting stories are created when the Vice or Virtue coincide with the character's desire, forming a conflict of some sort - the area where the treasure is hidden is inhabited by a colony of snakes, or the town guard keeps arresting the character for public drunkenness and disorder.

These factors, when carefully chosen, can help significantly in designing a character that is both interesting and rewarding to roleplay. As a general rule, if your character design is good, your Gamemaster will have numerous opportunities to weave your character's story into the narrative of the adventure; a bad character simply exists, without contributing anything of note to the narrative.

## Classes

Classes define your character's way of life. Your character's class helps shape his/her combat style and methods of overcoming various obstacles. Your class provides a pathway, granting special powers and features for your character.

A simple overview of the available classes is listed here. For full details, see the chapter on _Classes, Spells and Powers_.

**Fighters** wear and use any kind of armor, shield, and weapon. They gain a +3 bonus to Physical and add +1 to all attack and damage rolls, increasing by +1 at every 5th level. They also gain additional HP (based on STR) when they level up.

**Rogues** can use light armor, can use bucklers, and can use simple weapons and complex light weapons. They have a +3 bonus to Guile. Rogues can _Sneak Attack_ with a successful stealth roll (usually Guile+DEX), and gain the _Evade_ ability at level 5.

**Mages** wear no armor, can not use shields, and can use simple weapons. They can cast arcane spells (Mage), and gain a +3 bonus to Knowledge.

**Clerics** can wear light or medium armor, can not use shields, and can use simple weapons. They cast divine spells (Cleric) and gain a +3 bonus to Communication. A Cleric can _Turn Undead_ with a successful Magic Attack.

**Paladins** wear and use any kind of armor, shield, and weapon. They gain +1 to Physical and a +2 bonus to Communication. Paladins can _Detect Evil_ and heal others by _Laying on Hands_, and gain _Divine Favor_ at level 5.

**Rangers** wear light or medium armor, can use shields, and can use simple weapons, complex ranged weapons, and complex one-handed weapons. They gain a +1 bonus to Guile and a +2 bonus to Physical. They have +1 to ranged weapon rolls and incur less of a penalty for fighting with 2 weapons. Rangers gain the _Trapper_ ability at level 5.

**Illusionists** wear no armor, can not use shields, and can use simple weapons. They can cast arcane spells (Illusionist) and gain a +2 bonus to Communication and a +1 bonus to Guile.

**Druids** wear any non-metal armor, can use non-metal shields, and can use simple weapons. They cast divine spells (Druid) and gain +2 to Knowledge and +1 to Physical. Druids are immune to the effects of woodland fey, can _Pass Without Trace_ at 3rd level, and take the form of a small or medium sized animal at 7th level.

**Bards** wear light armor, can use bucklers, and can use simple weapons and complex light weapons. They gain +2 to Communication and +1 to Guile. A Bard can counter sound-based effects with _Performance_, and can _Charm Person_ or _Remove Fear_ with a successful skill roll. A Bard can also cast spells as either a Druid or Illusionist of 5 levels lower.

**Psions** can use light armor, can not use shields, and can use simple weapons. They can manifest Psion powers and gain +2 to Knowledge and +1 to Communication.

After choosing your character's race and class, you will need to set your character's starting Stats and Skills.

## Stats

There are 3 core stats that define a character:

**Strength** (STR): Strength represents the physical prowess of the character. It defines their resilience and toughness as well as how hard they can hit, how much they can carry, and how healthy they are.

**Dexterity** (DEX): Dexterity represents the character's coordination, precision, agility, reflexes, balance and movement. Dexterity controls how accurate a character is with a ranged or thrown weapon.

**Mind** (MIND): Mind represents the character's analytical thinking, as well as their wisdom, memory, knowledge of esoteric lore, and general intelligence. Mind also represents a character's magical competence.

When creating a character, you get 10 points to freely spend on your core stats, as long as no single stat is higher than 6. For example, a Fighter may choose to have 6 STR, 4 DEX, and 0 MIND.

**Stat Bonus:** For any stat, the Stat Bonus is that stat's value divided by two, rounding down. If the stat is negative, round towards negative infinity.

These three primary stats are used to determine several extremely important secondary stats:

**Hit Points (HP)**: Hit Points determine how healthy a character is. As they are injured or hurt, their HP depletes. A character's starting HP is determined with the following formula:

	10 + STR stat + 1d6(with a minimum of 3)

**Magic Points (MP)**: Magic Points determine how many spells a character can cast before resting. Each spell cast depletes a portion of MP, and characters with no MP cannot cast spells. A character's starting MP is determined with the following formula:

	6 + MIND bonus + 1d3

**Speed** comes in 3 tiers, and determines how far a character can move in a round. Characters are either Slow (20ft.), Normal (30ft.), or Fast (35ft.). A character's Speed is determined by the game master and can be affected by spells and conditions.

Typically, Fighters or Paladins with Heavy armor are Slow, Rogues and Rangers are Fast, and the rest are Normal speed. When playing on a grid, 5ft. is approximately 1 grid square.

**Armor Class (AC):** A character's Armor Class represents their ability to evade or block physical attacks. The higher a character's AC, the more difficult it is to land a damaging blow. A character's Armor Class is determined by this formula:

	10 + DEX bonus + Armor bonus + Racial bonus (if applicable)

**Carrying Capacity:** A character's carrying capacity represents the number and weight of items they are able to easily carry without being overburdened. The capacity is equal to `5 + STR bonus`, and can be increased with a backpack.

## Skills & Saves

There are 4 skills: **Physical**, **Guile**, **Knowledge**, and **Communication**. Skills are assigned a starting value of 0, and are improved by Class, Race, and allocated skill points. Roll higher than the given Difficulty Class to succeed.

**Skill Rank** = any bonus due to your class or race + any allocated points.

**Skill Roll** = d20 + skill rank + whatever stat bonus is most applicable to the use + situation modifiers

For example, Climbing would use Physical + STR bonus; dodging a falling rock is Physical + DEX bonus; finding a trap is Guile + MIND bonus, and disabling a trap is Guile + DEX bonus.

The Gamemaster may allow other characters to assist a character when performing a skill roll, when appropriate. A character being assisted in an action rolls twice, and uses the higher of the two rolls.

**Save Roll** = d20 + stat bonus + situation modifiers

For compatibility purposes, the 3 saves in Microluxe20 (STR save, DEX save, and MIND save), directly match Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves (often called "saving throws") found in other SRD-based games. Save rolls may not be assisted by other characters.

<!-- $page-break -->

## Level Advancement

Characters gain XP (or Experience Points) from defeating monsters, disarming traps, or from handling situations in innovative ways, at the GM's discretion. XP is awarded to all characters who take part in the encounter.

**XP Gained** = Hit Dice of defeated monsters, or the given XP for the trap, situation, etc. Add +1 for each doubling of the number of foes.

> **Example:** Kobolds have 1 hit die, so 1 kobold = 1 XP. 2 kobolds are double the amount, so 2 kobolds = 2 XP (1 XP for first kobold + 1 XP for doubling). 4 kobolds are double the amount _again_, so 4 kobolds = 3 XP. A Black Bear has 3 hit die, so 1 Black Bear = 3 XP. 2 Black Bears = 4 XP. 4 Black Bears = 5 XP.

As characters participate in encounters, they will begin to accumulate XP. Characters advance to the next level when they have gained XP equal to 10 times their current level. After advancing, the total XP is reset to 0. If a character has more XP than is required for the next level, keep the excess XP and add it after resetting the character's XP to 0. For example, if a level 1 character has 8XP and is awarded 4XP, the character advances to level 2 with 2XP.

> **Example:** The 1st level adventurers have just completed a dungeon adventure, and defeated five 1 XP encounters, a 2 XP trap and the 3 XP leader. That's a total of 10 XP, so they all advance to level 2. They need to gain another 20 XP to reach Level 3.

Alternatively, Gamemasters may decide to award levels at specific narrative milestones, instead of using an XP-based system. This is recommended for more experienced Gamemasters and for longer, story-focused campaigns.

Regardless of how they are awarded, each level adds:

* +1d6 to Hit Points (with a minimum of 3). Fighters also get additional HP equal to their STR bonus.

* Spellcasters gain additional Magic Points equal to 1d3 + MIND bonus.

* +2 points to spend on skills. When upgrading skills, you cannot add more points to a skill if it is equal to or higher than your character's level.

* Every 3rd level (3, 6, 9, 12, etc.), characters gain +1 STR, DEX, or MIND.

* Fighters gain +1 to their attack and damage rolls every 5 levels (5, 10, 15, etc.)

* New spell and power levels are unlocked at even-numbered levels (2, 4, 6, 8, etc.)

# Gameplay

When playing Microluxe20, the game will follow a basic pattern:

1. The GM shows or describes the world. The GM tells the players where they are and what they are doing, explaining any lore or recent happenings. For example, the GM may describe a small town that the players have just entered, telling them that they see a small stable, an inn and a few farm houses. The GM may elaborate, saying there are mountains in the distance, or bloody footprints on the ground near one of the farm house entrances.

2. The players decide on what they want to do, and describe their actions to the GM. Outside of combat, one player may speak for the whole party, or maybe each player has their own plans on what they want to do or investigate. The players don't necessarily need to take turns, but the GM still needs to be able to listen to each player's decision and resolve it. Decision resolution can be simple (for example, if the player simply wants to open the farm door, the GM can just tell the player what they see inside) or complex (perhaps the door is locked and the player must work out a way to get inside). In more complex situations, the GM may make use of dice rolls to determine the outcome of the player's action.

3. After the player decides on their action and describes it, the GM responds with the results of the player's action. Once the GM describes the outcome, the pattern starts over again, returning to step 1.

This pattern is used for any conflict resolution, aside from combat. Once combat begins in a situation, the game switches to a more rigid and structured ruleset, where players take turns deciding on and completing actions. Outside of combat, this basic pattern continues to keep everything fluid and simple, continually adapting to the adventure's storyline.

## Combat

When entering combat, the pace of the game shifts from the free-form nature of exploration to tightly structured units of time called 'rounds', in which each character gets one turn. On their turn, characters may move up to their maximum speed and take one additional action (attack, cast a spell, move again, speak with someone, etc.), unless they are immobilized, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated.

The order in which characters take their turns in combat is determined by rolling d20 + DEX bonus for **initiative** at the start of each round (ties are settled with a re-roll).

### Attacking and Defending

When making an attack, roll a d20, adding the appropriate **attack bonus** for the action. If the resulting total is greater than your opponent's Armor Class (AC), it's a hit. Natural 20 is automatically a critical, dealing additional damage equal to your weapon's maximum damage.

Melee attack bonuses are used for martial weapons, Ranged attack bonuses are used for thrown and ranged weapons, and Magic attack bonuses are used for spells and magical items with special powers.

| **Melee Attack Bonus:** | **Ranged Attack Bonus:** | **Magic Attack Bonus:** |
| :- | :- | :- |
| STR bonus + Character Level | DEX bonus + Character Level | MIND bonus + Character Level |

For each attack that hits, roll the damage die code of your weapon or spell, adding any bonuses from your class or weapon, and subtract the resulting total from your opponent's HP. An attack that hit always deals at least 1 damage.

> **Example:** Your Human Paladin has hit an enemy Orc with his Greatsword (2d6, Complex). He rolls two six-sided die, getting 4+5 for a total of 9. Since it is a Complex weapon, he adds his strength bonus of +2, for 11 HP damage total. The Orc, having a meager 9 HP left, is killed instantly.

<!-- $page-break -->

When all characters (including Gamemaster's characters) have taken their turn, the round is over. If there are any opponents left alive or not incapacitated, a new round begins. Otherwise, combat is over.

## Special Combat Rules

While the basics of combat apply in all situations, some players may want to do more than just wield a single weapon or make a normal attack every turn. These rules are designed to allow players greater freedom in their playstyle.

**Fighters**, **Rogues**, **Rangers**, and **Bards** may wield 2 light weapons and attack with both in a round, if they take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls that round. Rangers take a -1 penalty instead.

**Fighters** and **Rogues** may use their Ranged Attack bonus (DEX + Level) instead of their Melee Attack bonus (STR + Level) when attacking with a Light melee weapon.

If a character's attack bonus is +6 or more, they can make an additional strike or fire another projectile at the same target (a "sub-attack") by taking a -5 penalty to each attack's bonus. This can be carried out up to three times, so long as the resulting attack bonus is +1 or more.

> **Example:** if your character's total Melee Attack bonus is +12, you can choose to strike three times (at +2/+2/+2), twice (at +7/+7), or once at +12. However, you can't split the strikes up between different targets.

When a character exits the melee range of a hostile character, the hostile character may be able to attack them, at the GM's discretion. This is called an Attack of Opportunity, and is carried out like a normal attack. Characters unable to take a normal combat action may not make an Attack of Opportunity.

Attempting to attack a specific part of a hostile character or target is known as a Called Shot, and is made at a -2 or greater penalty to Attack bonus. Successfully hitting a Called Shot may have special effects such as wounding or incapacitating the target, or may simply act like a normal attack, as determined by the GM.

Attempting to knock out, restrain, or trip a hostile character with an attack is considered a Called Shot, with appropriate penalties to Attack bonus as determined by the GM.

Characters wielding a Complex melee weapon in one hand add their STR bonus to the damage total. Characters wielding a Two-Handed melee weapon add 1½ times their STR bonus to the damage total.

### Unconsciousness and Death

If a player's character is damaged to the point where their HP reaches zero (or below zero), the character becomes "downed", or unconscious and near death, with 0 HP. Further damage directly reduces their normally highest stat (either STR, DEX, or MIND). If that stat drops below -10, the character dies.

Unless the Game Master decides otherwise, monsters and non-player characters die when brought to zero HP.

Each turn while downed, roll a d6 at the start of your turn. If you roll above a 3, you are stabilized and return to 1 HP. Otherwise, if you are unsuccessful for 3 turns, your character dies. Healing items or spells will stabilize downed characters, and they restore a character's HP as normal.

Some attacks drain a specific Stat instead of HP. If a character has one of their stats drained to -10 or below, the character is downed and treated as if they were reduced to 0 HP. Damage while downed is applied to the character's next highest Stat instead of the Stat which caused the character to become downed.

All stat damage taken while downed or in combat is restored after 24 hours have elapsed and the character takes a long rest.

<!-- $page-break -->

## Spells

Spellcasters may cast any of their class spells as long as the spell level is equal to or below their class level. When casting a spell, characters make a Magic Attack, rolling 1d20 + Magic Attack Bonus. If the resulting roll is greater than the Spell Difficulty Class, the spell is successfully cast.

**Spell Difficulty Class (DC):** 10 (or spell-specific difficulty) + Spell Level + Target's MIND Bonus

When casting a spell against an inanimate object, the target's MIND bonus is not considered part of the DC.

If the spell is successfully cast it immediately takes effect, unless the spell states that the target may make a specific save against the spell's effects. For example, a spell that forms spikes that protrude from the ground may allow the target to make a DEX save to try and escape the spell.

Casting a spell of any kind costs Magic Points, regardless of the outcome. The cost is equal to the level of the spell being cast. For example, a 2nd level spell will cost the caster 2 MP.

A spellcaster may cast spells without expending MP by casting the spell over a duration of 10 minutes for each MP that would be otherwise be expended. Casting a spell over time cannot be done in combat, and cannot be used to partially lower the MP cost of a spell. Casting a spell over time does not escape arcane/divine influence.

Once a spellcaster has cast a spell in an encounter, they enter a state called "arcane (or divine) influence". While in this state, their HP *cannot* be healed normally until they have a short rest. Healing spells cast on an injured caster under arcane/divine influence only heal ¼ of the given amount. Spellcasters automatically exit their influenced state after 1 hour of rest.

There is no need to memorize spells in advance. Just because a character can cast any spell, doesn't mean that they should. Choose spells that suit the character.

Starting at 1st level, select one "signature" spell per spell level that the character prefers to use over any other. These spells are easier to cast due to familiarity, costing 2 MP less to use. Spells that do damage to a target (e.g. _Magic Missile_, _Produce Flame_) always cost at least 1 MP to cast, even if they are a signature spell.

### Casting Metamagic

Metamagic is the name for spells that alter or enhance the effect of another spell, allowing spellcasters to introduce some variety into their existing spells. Metamagic can be cast by any spellcaster, from a rod or as an action, regardless of whether the spellcaster is the one casting the spell being affected.

A Magic Attack roll is not normally required to cast metamagic. However, if the target spell's caster rejects the metamagic being cast on the spell, the metamagic's caster must make a Magic Attack roll against the target Spell Difficulty Class to affect the target spell.

If a caster is attempting to cast metamagic on their own spell, the metamagic and the spell must be cast as separate actions, one after the other. This restriction is ignored if the caster is using a rod enchanted with metamagic, or if another caster is casting the metamagic.

Here are some of the most common metamagic spells:

**Extending** makes a spell last twice as long as it normally would. Extending a spell costs 2 MP.

**Empowering** makes a spell do 50% more damage than normal. Empowering a spell costs 3 MP.

**Widening** makes a spell's area of effect twice as big as normal. Widening a spell costs 4 MP.

**Limiting** makes a spell last half as long as it normally would. Limiting a spell costs 2 MP.

**Depowering** makes a spell do 50% less damage than normal. Depowering a spell costs 3 MP.

**Narrowing** makes a spell's area of effect half as large as normal. Narrowing a spell costs 4 MP.

**Attuning** changes the damage type of a spell to a specific element. Attuning a spell costs 3 MP if a material component of the specified element is easily available to the caster; otherwise it costs 5 MP. Spells which already deal elemental damage cannot be Attuned.

If two opposing metamagics are cast on the same spell, they cancel each other out.


## Magic Items

*Author's Note:* This section is intended to establish a common baseline for magical items. Gamemasters are encouraged to customize or even ignore this section as needed to fit their setting.

Magical items can be broadly divided into two categories: Active and Passive. Active magical items require some action on the part of the character to make use of their magical effects, while passive items provide their effect at all times. Using an active item may require a skill check of some sort, and may require the character to expend MP in the same fashion spellcasting does.

### Common Active Items:

**Staves:** The main tool of a spellcaster, the staff is a focus used to harness magical energy. Spellcasters usually require a staff to cast a spell. Staves may also contain one or more spells that the caster would not normally have access to; these spells can only be cast while wielding the staff. Spellcasters can create these at 9th level.

**Rods:** Usually employed for easier metamagic, rods may contain a single spell or magical effect. This spell can be cast by anyone for the appropriate MP cost, but non-spellcasting characters do so at +2 or more to the difficulty. Rods with a metamagic effect may be used in tandem with staves when casting a spell. Spellcasters can create these at 5th level.

**Wands:** Sometimes described as "magic-in-a-stick", a wand contains a single spell and a set number of charges. While there are charges left, any character may use the wand to cast the contained spell at the expense of a charge. Wands can be recharged, but usually require a significant MP cost for each charge. Spellcasters can create these at 5th level.

**Potions:** A single-use magical item, potions are a bottled magical liquid. When consumed, a potion confers a magical effect on the character that drank it. Spellcasters can create these at 3rd level.

**Scrolls:** Scrolls are small sheets of parchment that allow any character to cast a single spell simply by saying the text out loud. Reading a scroll does not require a character to understand the language it is written in, and completely destroys it. Spellcasters may use Read Magic to decipher a scroll without casting (and destroying) it. Spellcasters can create these at 1st level.

### Common Passive Items:

**Amulets, Charms, Rings, etc:** Various items of jewelery may be enchanted to provide a magical effect. Most items of this sort provide a bonus to a stat or skill, but more spectacular effects are possible. Spellcasters can create these at 3rd level.

**Armor and Weapons:** Enchanted armor and weapons are usually the mark of a wealthy adventurer or noble, and usually provide some form of passive effect, ranging from a simple 'torchlight' effect to damage reduction, elemental resistances or bonuses, and more. Spellcasters can create Armor at 7th level, and Weapons at 9th level.

### Creating Magic Items

The process to enchant an item with a magical effect differs slightly from item to item (and at the Gamemaster's discretion) but they all follow a similar pattern in their creation. Most enchantments will require access to special tools of some kind - potions will require a cauldron and beakers, wands and rods require tools to carve the magical trace-work into their surface, and jewelery requires fine tools to shape the item and socket gems into their proper places.

To begin the process, the player needs to have the base form of the item and purchase materials to perform the enchantment, and the spellcaster performing the enchantment must know the spell or use a scroll with the wanted spell. All materials used in the process are consumed, as well as any scrolls used as a source.

The cost of materials used to create a magical item is usually equal to 1/2 the MP cost of the enchantment process, in gold pieces. Thus, infusing a wand with a 1 MP spell would cost 2 gp, 5 sp in materials.

The enchantment process will require a spellcaster to infuse the item with MP equal to 5 times the cost of the spell or effect being enchanted with. A spellcaster takes a full hour to infuse 5 MP into an item, and the infusion process places the character under Arcane Influence. No more than one spellcaster may infuse an item at a time.

When creating a scroll or potion, the infusion MP cost is twice the MP cost of the spell being scribed.

When creating an item with magical charges, the maximum number of charges the item can hold is determined by `5 + Magic bonus (Mind + Level)`. Each charge requires twice the MP cost of the spell, but the item may be recharged at any point.

When the infusion process is finished, the character rolls MIND+Knowledge, and the result of the roll determines the effectiveness of the enchantment.

| Result: | Effect |
| :------ | :----- |
| Natural 1 | Critical Failure! The item is destroyed and the enchanter is reduced to 0 HP and is Unconscious. |
| 2-9 | Failure! All extra materials used are destroyed, but the base item is undamaged. |
| 10-15 | Minor Success! The item is enchanted, but the user must make a DC 15 Magic roll to use the item. |
| 15+ | Success! The item is successfully enchanted, and no other effect occurs. |
| Natural 20 | Critical Success! The item is successfully enchanted, and gains +50% to its effectiveness. |

> **Example:** Your Mage wants to imbue a wand with Prestidigitation. This is a 1st-level Mage spell, so it will take 5 MP to enchant the wand, and 25 sp in material costs. Your Magic bonus is +3, so you decide to infuse it with three of the eight charges to start, bringing the total MP cost to 11.
>
>You can only infuse 5 MP per hour, so you must focus on infusing the wand for slightly over two hours. You roll MIND+Knowledge when you have finished infusing the wand and - Presto! - you get a 17! The wand is successfully crafted, holding 3 / 8 charges.

## Resting & Recuperating

After players have been in combat, they may need to rest to regain their stamina. There are 2 forms of resting:

**Short Rest:** Resting for at least an hour constitutes a short rest. Spellcasters are no longer under arcane/divine influence once they have taken a short rest.

**Long Rest:** Resting for at least 4 hours constitutes a long rest. A long rest cures most short-term status effects, and is otherwise functionally identical to a short rest.

While resting, characters heal HP equal to `STR bonus + 1d8` per hour of rest. Bandages and other healing items usually require that a character take at least a short rest to heal HP. Healing items that require a rest are not affected by arcane/divine influence.

Spellcasters regain MP equal to `MIND bonus + 1d6` per hour of rest. A long rest restores all of a character's Magic Points.

Potions and spells of Cure Wounds instantly heal a character without requiring a rest, but have significantly reduced effect on a character under arcane/divine influence.

<!-- $page-break -->

## Heroism

**Heroism** is intended to relieve some of the power incompatibilities with some d20 adventure types. If you find that the party is consistently too weak, try adding Heroism. **Heroism** is a bonus equal to the character's level that may be applied to an Attack Bonus, Damage roll, Saving Throw, or Skill Check. Heroism may be used up to three times per day.

## Light

The lighting conditions of an area have a subtle but important effect on a character. The precise details are up to the Gamemaster, but for convenience this handbook divides lighting conditions into three broad categories:

**Bright:** Lit by the sun, a bright lamp, or a spell of Light, you can see clearly and discern fine detail. All actions are taken as normal.

**Dim:** A flickering candle or a dim lantern casts light here; characters can't see beyond medium range and have a difficult time making out details. In Dim lighting, all attack rolls take a -1 or greater penalty, and skill checks involving perception or detailed work take a -2 to -4 penalty.

**Dark:** New moon or the inside of a cave; most characters cannot see anything beyond short range, and determining detail is almost impossible. All attack rolls take a -4 or greater penalty, and affected skill checks fail at the Gamemaster's discretion.

## Range

Instead of a tabletop grid system, Microluxe20 uses narrative ranges determined by the Game Master. Five ranges are used throughout the handbook: **Self**, **Touch**, **Short**, **Medium**, and **Long**. Self refers to only your character and any items or clothing you are holding or wearing. The other ranges correspond to a maximum distance according to the table below:

| Range:   | Touch: | Short: | Medium: | Long:   |
| :-----   | :----- | :----- | :------ | :----   |
| Distance | < 5ft. | 30 ft. | 120 ft. | 480 ft. |

## Inventory Size and Weight

**Bulk** determines how many items a character can carry on their person or in their inventory. Items are classified according to their size and weight into one of four size classes:

- **Tiny** items that can be stacked together like arrows or coins count for 1 Bulk for every 20 items.
- **Small** items can be comfortably held in one hand, like daggers, loaves of bread, or potions, and  count for 1 Bulk.
- **Medium** items are the size of a normal arm, like long swords, bows, or bedrolls, and count for 3 Bulk.
- **Large** items are the size of a torso, like a tower shield, empty barrels, or a full set of armor, and count for 5 Bulk.

Anything larger is left to the Game Master's discretion as to whether a character is capable of even lifting it.

A character's Carry Capacity determines how much Bulk they can carry without being overburdened. Backpacks, satchels, and other containers can increase the character's capacity. An overburdened character takes -1 to all Dex checks and attack rolls for each point of Bulk they are overburdened by.

## Basic Mass Combat
Most combat is carried out one-on-one, with each set of stats (HP, AC, combat bonuses, etc) applying to a single character or creature. However, combat can be extended by using Combat Scale. Combat Scale is a multiplier that shows the amount of characters or creatures relative to their normal single-unit size. It is only applied to damage in combat between units of different size. Hit Points, AC and all other stats remain the same.

For example, a unit of 20 Goblin warriors will have CSx5 as per the table below. The combat stats are still HD1d8+1 (5HP), AC15, Morningstar +2 (1d6) or Javelin +3 (1d4). Against anything with the same Combat Scale (for example, a unit of 15 Elves), combat is resolved normally as if it was one goblin against one elf.

|COMBAT SCALE CHART||||||||||
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Number in Unit**|2-5|6-10|11-20|21-40|41-80|81-160|161-320|321-640|etc.|
|**Combat Scale**|x3|x4|x5|x6|x7|x8|x9|x10|etc.|

Combat Scale comes into play when battling against forces of a different size. It acts as a multiplier for damage taken, and also divides any damage given. If the battle started between units of different CS, reduce the size of the Combat Scale as Hit Points as lost. For example, if the twenty Goblin warriors above are reduced to 2HP, they have lost over half of their unit, so they are now CSx4. When down to just 1HP, they are CSx3 with only 5 goblins remaining.

If the Combat Scale becomes the same for all opponents, resolve combat normally; the playing field is now level.

### Calculating Experience

Experience is gained from taking part in a battle equal to the Hit Die of the opponent, +1 for each CS higher than your own. For example, a member of the 20-strong Knights of the Rose (CSx5) will earn 3 XP after defeating an army of 35 Gnolls (a 2 Hit Die creature, CSx6).

### Mass Combat Example: Knights vs Dragon

The 500-strong Knights of the Rose stand ready against the young Dragon. They are CSx10, while the Dragon, a single creature, is just CSx1, though formidable.

500 Knights: HD2d8+4 (14HP), AC18, Lance +7 (1d10+4) or Longsword +6 (1d8+2), CSx10
Dragon: HD13×12+39 (123HP), AC21, Bite +20 (2d6+7) or Breath 10d10 DC24

The Dragon flies high above and breathes flames across their formation for 46HP damage. The knights dive for cover beneath their shields (Physical + DEX to dodge DC24. They roll 25, barely making it). They take ½ damage – 23HP, divided by CSx10 for 2HP. The Knights are down to 12HP.

They ready their horses to charge as the Dragon lands, the thunder of 2,000 hooves makes the young dragon hesitate. They hit (rolled 18+7 = 25 vs. AC21), scoring 11 damage, CSx10 for a massive 110HP damage. The Dragon is down to 13HP against the small army, bleeding from the impact of many lances. It roars and lunges in anger, biting savagely. It hits easily (rolled 6+20 = 26 vs. AC18) for 17 damage, divided by 10 = 2HP. The Knights are down to 10HP. If they fall below 7HP they will be at half their numbers and down to CSx9.

They draw their Longswords and surround the downed Dragon, though their weapons do little more than scratch the drake's hide (6 + 8 = 14, a miss). The Dragon turns to bite again, and rolls a Natural 20. It's a critical, so the Knights take 19HP damage, CSx10 so 2HP lost. They are down to 8HP after watching a few more of their number be gobbled up.

Their longswords bit true (18 +6 = 24 vs. AC21), for 6HP damage, CSx10 for a total of 60HP against the drake. It's down, finally, though the Knights have lost 143 (500×4/14) of their number in the battle. They commend their souls in valor.
