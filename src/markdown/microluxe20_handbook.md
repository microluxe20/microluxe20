# Introduction

This is a modified version of the Microlite20 rules, designed to be a more complete experience, while still continuing to be extremely easy to setup and play. The goal is to build off of the already-simplified Microlite20 rule-set, but also introduce more complete classes, additional races, and a more intuitive set of weapons, armor, and spells. It also maintains compatibility with any Primary Fantasy SRD resources.

# Basic Rules

## Character Creation

When creating a character in Microluxe20, you will need to decide on a race and class. After choosing your character's race and class, you can configure their stats, skills/saves, and other combat/magic information.

## Stats

There are 3 stats: **Strength** (STR), **Dexterity** (DEX) and **Mind** (MIND).

Roll 4d6, drop lowest dice. Total remaining 3 dice and allocate to one of the stats. Repeat for remaining stats. Don't feel like rolling? Allocate 16,13, and 10 to your stats.

Stat bonus = (STAT-10) /2, round down.

## Skills & Saves

There are 4 skills: **Physical** , **Guile** , **Knowledge** , and **Communication**. Roll higher than the given Difficulty Class to succeed.

Skill rank = your level + any bonus due to your class or race.

Skill roll = d20 + skill rank + whatever stat bonus is most applicable to the use + situation modifiers

For example, Climbing would use Physical + STR bonus. Dodging a falling rock is Physical + DEX bonus. Finding a trap is Guile + MIND bonus. Disabling a trap is Guile + DEX bonus.

There are 3 saves: **Fortitude** , **Reflex** , and **Will**. For Fortitude and Reflex saving throws, use Physical + STR or DEX bonus. Saving against magic (Will save) is MIND bonus + your level.

## Races
|Race|Bonus|Race|Bonus|
|:---|:---|:--- |:--- |
| **Humans** | +1 to all skill rolls|**Goblins** | +3 DEX, -1 MIND |
| **Great Elves** | +2 MIND | **Giants** | +3 STR, -1 DEX |
| **Forest Elves** | +2 DEX | **Orcs** | +3 STR, -1 MIND |
| **Halflings** | +1 DEX, +1 STR | **Dwarmir** | +1 STR, +1 to any 1 Skill & can use a Waraxe, regardless of class |
| **Gnomes** | +1 DEX, +1 MIND | **Elvir** | +1 DEX, and +1 to any 1 Skill |
| **Forged** | +2 natural armor bonus to AC | **Orkeir** | +2 STR, -1 MIND, +1 to Physical skill |
| **Dwarves** | +2 STR & can use a Waraxe, regardless of class | **Tauremir** | +2 STR, -1 MIND,  +1 to any 1 Skill |
| **Minotaurs** | +3 STR, -1 MIND | **Gorimir** | a +1 DEX, and +1 to any 1 Skill |
| **Lycanthropes** | +1 DEX, +1 to Guile skill | **Slaan** | +2 MIND, +1 DEX, -1 to STR |

## Classes

**Fighters** wear and use any kind of armor, shield, and weapon. They gain a +3 bonus to Physical and add +1 to all attack and damage rolls. This increases by +1 at 5th level and every five levels onward. Fighters gain the Cleave ability at level 5. If the Fighter's melee attack drops or slays a foe, the fighter is granted one additional attack against another opponent in range that round. This ability can compound, meaning if one swing kills the second foe, the Fighter can continue to attack until he/she either misses or doesn't kill the foe with the attack.

**Rogues** can use light armor, can use bucklers, and can use simple weapons and complex light weapons. They have a +3 bonus to Guile. If they successfully Sneak (usually Guile+DEX, but depends on situation) up on a foe they can add their Guile skill rank to the damage of their first attack.

**Mages** wear no armor, can not use shields, and can use simple weapons. They can cast arcane spells, and gain a +3 bonus to Knowledge.

**Clerics** can wear light or medium armor, can not use shields, and can use simple weapons. They cast divine spells and gain +3 bonus to Communication. A Cleric can _Turn Undead_ with a successful Magic Attack. DC is the current HP of the Undead. If the DC is exceeded by 10 it is destroyed. This can be used (2 + Level + MIND Bonus) times per day.

**Paladins** wear and use any kind of armor, shield, and weapon. They gain +1 to Physical and a +2 bonus to Communication. They are immune to diseases and apply a +1 bonus to all saving throws (this increases by +1 at 5th level and every 5 levels onward). Paladins can _detect evil_ within 60 ft. at will and can heal up to 2 HP per level per day by _laying on hands_.

**Rangers** wear light or medium armor, can use shields, and can use simple weapons, complex ranged weapons, and complex one-handed weapons. They gain +1 to hit and to damage with ranged weapons and only incur a -1 to hit penalty when fighting with 2 weapons. They have a +1 bonus to Guile and a +2 bonus to Physical.

**Illusionists** wear no armor, can not use shields, and can use simple weapons. They can cast Illusionist spells and gain a +2 bonus to Communication and a +1 bonus to Guile.

**Druids** wear any non-metal armor, can use non-metal shields, and can use simple weapons. They cast Druid spells and gain +2 to Knowledge and +1 to Physical. Druids are immune to the spell-like effects of woodland fey. At 3rd level a Druid can _pass without trace_ (be untraceable) at will. At 7th level a Druid can assume the form of any small or medium sized animal up to 3 times per day. A Druid heals 2 HP per level when changing back into his/her human form.

**Bards** wear light armor, can use bucklers, and can use simple weapons and complex light weapons. They gain +2 to Communication and +1 to Guile. A Bard can counter sound-based effects within a 30 ft. radius. A Bard can use his/her song to _charm person_ or _remove fear_ (vs DC) up to 3 times (total) per day. Beginning at 6th level, a Bard casts spells as either a Druid or Illusionist (player's choice) of 5 levels lower.

**Psions** can use light armor, can not use shields, and can use simple weapons. They can manifest Psion powers and gain +2 to Knowledge and +1 to Communication.

## Combat

**Hit Points (HP)** = STR Stat + 1d6/Level. If HP reaches zero, the player becomes "downed", or unconscious and near death. Further damage directly reduces STR. If that reaches zero, the player dies. When down, roll a d20. You have 3 chances to roll above a 10. If successful, you are stable and return to 1 HP (STR is returned to normal as well). Otherwise, if unsuccessful 3 times, the player dies.

**Speed** comes in 3 tiers. You are either Slow(20ft.), Normal(30ft.) or Fast(35ft.).  Speed is determined by the game master and can be affected by spells and conditions. Typically, Fighters or Paladins with Heavy armor are Slow, Rogues and Rangers are Fast, and the rest are Normal speed. (5ft. is approximately 1 "Square")

**Armor Class (AC)** = 10 + DEX bonus + Armor bonus + Racial bonus.

Roll d20 + DEX bonus for **initiative** order. Everyone can move and do one action each turn (attack, cast a spell, move again, speak with someone, etc.).

Melee attack bonus = STR bonus + Level

Missile attack bonus = DEX bonus + Level

Magic attack bonus = MIND bonus + Level

Add attack bonus to d20 roll. If higher than your opponent's Armor Class (AC), it's a hit. Natural 20 is automatically a critical doing maximum damage.

Fighters and Rogues can use DEX bonus + Level as Melee attack bonus instead if wielding a light weapon. Fighters, Rogues, Bards, and Rangers can wield 2 light weapons and attack with both in a round if they take a -2 penalty (Rangers don't take the penalty) on all attack rolls that round.

If the total bonus is +6 or more, a second attack can be made with a -5 penalty. If the total bonus is +11 or more a third attack can be made at -10. For example, if the total bonus is +12, three attacks can be made at +12/+7/+2.

Add STR bonus to Melee damage, x2 for 2-handed weapons.

## Magic

Spellcasters can cast any of their class spells, with a spell level equal or below 1/2 their class level, rounded up. Casting a spell of any kind costs Hit Points. The cost is 1 + double the level of the spell being cast:

|Spell Cost Table|||||||||||
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spell Level** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| **HP Cost** | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 13 | 15 | 17 | 19 |

Once a spellcaster has cast a spell in an encounter, their HP **cannot** be healed normally until 8 hours of rest (long rest). Healing spells cast on an injured caster only heal ¼ of the given amount.

There is no need to memorize spells in advance. Just because a character can cast any spell, doesn't mean that they should. Choose spells that suit the character. Select one "signature" spell per spell level from 1st upward that they prefer to use over any other. These spells are easier to cast due to familiarity, costing 2 less HP to use.

**Spell Difficulty Class (DC)** for all spells: 10 + Caster Level + Caster's MIND bonus

When a spell is cast, the target of the spell must make a DC save (d20), unless the spell requires a different save. If the target scores lower than the caster's DC, they are affected by the spell.

Here are three ways for spell casters to add a little more variety:

**Extending** makes a spell last twice as long as it normally would. An Extended spell costs an additional 2 HP.

**Empowering** makes a spell do 50% more damage than normal. An Empowered spell costs an additional 4 HP.

**Widening** makes a spell's area of effect twice as big as normal. A Widened spell costs an additional 6 HP.

## Heroism

**Heroism** is intended to relieve some of the power incompatibilities with some d20 adventure types. If you find that the party is consistently too weak, try adding Heroism. **Heroism** is a bonus equal to 1 times the characters level (1 at 1st, 2 at 2nd, etc) and may be applied to up to three of the following once per day: Attack Bonus, Damage, Saving Throw, Skill Check, Spell DC

## Level Advancement

XP = Hit Dice of defeated monsters, or the given XP for the trap, situation, etc. Add +1 for each doubling of the number of foes. example: 1 kobold = 1 XP. 2 kobolds = 2 XP. 4 kobolds = 3 XP, etc.

Add up the  XP of every encounter you take part in. When the total = 10 x your current level, you've advanced to the next level. Reset the total to 0 after advancing.

Each level adds:

+1d6 to Hit Points, +1 to all attack rolls, +1 to all skills. If the level divides by three (ex: level 3,6,9,etc.) add 1 point to STR, DEX or MIND.

Fighters gain +1 to their attack and damage rolls at levels 5,10,15,etc.

New spell levels are unlocked at levels 3,5,7,9,etc.

New power levels are unlocked at levels 2,4,6,8,etc.

**Example:** The 1st level adventurers have just completed a dungeon adventure, and defeated five 1 XP encounters, a 2 XP trap and the 3 XP leader. That's a total of 10 XP, so they all advance to level 2. They need to gain another 20 XP to reach Level 3.

# Equipment

## Starting Wealth

The most common coin is the _gold piece_ (gp).

## Psion Power List

Psionic characters can manifest any of their powers, so long as the power level is equal or below ½ their class level, rounded down (unlike spellcasters, who round-up). Unlike spells, all aspects of a power do not automatically scale with level. Instead, they are augmented with additional Hit Points (HP). The augmenting HP cost is noted under each power's entry. Like casters, Psions can select a "signature" power per power level from 1st upward, reducing its cost by 2 HP.

The combined HP cost for manifesting and augmenting a power cannot exceed the character's psionic class level. Thus, a 3rd level psion could manifest a level 1 power by spending 1 HP, and augment it by spending 2 additional HP for a total HP cost of 3.

Temporary HP cannot be used to manifest powers. Like casters, after casting a Psion power or spell, healing spells cast on an injured psion only heal ¼ of the given amount.

**Power Difficulty Class (DC):** 10 + Psionic Level + Psionic's MIND bonus

# Monster List

Any monster from just about any tabletop RPG may be used. The following list helps simplify SRD monsters for use in Microluxe20.

**Skills:** All creatures have a bonus to all skills (_Physical, Guile, Knowledge and Communication_) equal to their number of Hit Dice. If the creature is intelligent, add +3 to one skill. Add stat bonuses to suit and as logic dictates. This is intentionally kept open – if you need a sneaky bugbear, assign the +3 bonus to Guile; if a warrior, give +3 to Physical; for a spell-caster assign the +3 to Knowledge or Communication and give levels of Mage or Cleric (see below).

**Monster Advancement:** To make a tougher monster, add more Hit Dice; each additional Hit Die adds one to their skill and combat bonuses. For each doubling of the Hit Dice, increase the dice size for attacks (ex: d4- >d6, d6->d8, etc).

Alternatively, add class levels to intelligent monsters. Start with the base Hit Dice and add levels of Fighter, Rogue, Mage or Cleric as required.

**Create your own:** Assign Hit Dice (d8 for most things, d12 for Dragons and Undead). Attack bonus and skill level = number of Hit Dice. If it's an intelligent critter, add a +3 bonus to one skill. Add stat bonuses to suit.

## Animal

**Badger:**  HD 1d8+2 (6 HP), AC 15, Claw +4 (1d2–1)

**Black Bear:**  HD 3d8+6 (19 HP), AC 13, Claw +6 (1d4+4) or bite +1 (1d6+2)

**Brown Bear:**  HD 6d8+24 (51 HP), AC 15, Claw +11 (1d8+8) or bite +6 (2d6+4)

# Game Master's Guide

## Disease

Diseases have various symptoms and are spread through a number of ways. Several typical diseases are summarized below.

The entries for diseases include the following information:

**Name of the disease:** Type, DC, incubation, damage.

**Type** lists the disease's method of delivery (contact, inhaled, or injury).

**DC** lists the phys+STR check DC needed to prevent infection.

**Incubation** lists the time before damage begins.

**Damage** lists the ability damage the character takes after incubation and each day afterward.

**Cackle Fever:** Inhaled, DC 16, 1 day, –1d6 MIND.

**Filth Fever:** Injury, DC 12, 1d3 days, –1d3 DEX and 1d3 STR.

**Mindfire:** Inhaled, DC 12, 1 day, –1d4 MIND.

**Red Ache:** Injury, DC 15, 1d3 days, –1d6 STR.

**Shakes:** Contact, DC 13, 1 day, –1d8 DEX.

## Extreme Heat & Cold

If not wearing suitable protection, a character must make a Phys + STR check once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check), taking 1d6 damage on each failed save.

## Falling Damage

A falling character takes 1d6 HP of damage per 10 feet fallen. If the character makes a successful Phys + DEX roll, he/she takes only half damage. The DC for the Phys + DEX roll is equal to the depth fallen in feet.

In the event that the fall ends in an area laden with spikes or jagged rocks, add +1 HP of damage to falling damage per 10 feet fallen (with a maximum of +10 HP).

## Poison

Characters can possibly take damage from a weapon that has been poisoned, be attacked by a creature whose natural attacks feature poison, consume poison hidden in food or drink, or be poisoned in some other way.

Several typical poisons are summarized below. The entries for poisons include the following information:

**Name of the poison:** Type, DC, damage, price.

**Type:** lists the poison's method of delivery (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury).

**DC:** lists the phys+STR check DC needed to avoid the poison's damage.

**Damage:** is expressed as "xdx/xdx." The first number is the initial damage, taken immediately upon failing the Phys + STR check against the poison. The second number is the secondary damage, taken one minute after exposure to the poison if a second Phys + STR check is failed. Ability damage is temporary unless marked with an asterisk(\*), in which case the loss is permanent. Unconsciousness lasts 1d3 hours.

**Price:** lists the cost for one dose of the poison. It can usually only be obtained through less-than-reputable sources, as the possession of poisons are commonly illegal.

**Arsenic:**  Ingested, DC 13, -1 STR/-1d8 STR, 120 gp.

## When in Doubt... Remember

Whenever the players want to try something that goes around, through, or above and beyond the rules as written, you can always use the "GM's Friend"...the 50% chance.

Have them roll whatever check seems most appropriate. A roll of 1-10 is a failure, a roll of 11-20 is a success. If you feel that the situation warrants that you favor them, assign a +2 bonus to their roll. If the situation determines that they be hindered, then assign a –2 penalty.

# Appendix II: Magic Items & Mass Combat

## Magic Item Creation

Spellcasters gain the ability to make magical items at certain class levels. This translates to being able to buy these items, but at half their usual purchase price. This represents the raw materials required to make the item. Making items requires equipment (a forge, etc), the right skills, and time. Making magic items does not cost XP.

Here's when Spellcasters can make stuff:

| **Spellcaster's Level** | Item |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Scrolls |
| 3 | Potions and Wondrous Items |
| 5 | Wands and Armor |
| 9 | Rods and  Weapons |
| 12 | Staves and Rings |

## Basic Mass Combat

Most combat is carried out one-on-one, with each set of stats (HP, AC, combat bonuses, etc) applying to a single character or creature. However, combat can be extended by using Combat Scale. Combat Scale is a multiplier that shows the amount of characters or creatures relative to their normal single-unit size. It is only applied to damage in combat between units of different size. Hit Points, AC and all other stats remain the same.

For example, a unit of 20 Goblin warriors will have CSx5 as per the table below. The combat stats are still HD1d8+1 (5HP), AC15, Morningstar +2 (1d6) or Javelin +3 (1d4). Against anything with the same Combat Scale (for example, a unit of 15 Elves), combat is resolved normally as if it was one goblin against one elf.

| Number in Unit | Combat Scale |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2-5 | x3 |
| 6-10 | x4 |
| 11-20 | x5 |
| 21-40 | x6 |
| 41-80 | x7 |
| 81-160 | x8 |
| 161-320 | x9 |
| 321-640 | x10 |
| Etc |   |

Combat Scale comes into play when battling against forces of a different size. It acts as a multiplier for damage taken, and also divides any damage given. If the battle started between units of different CS, reduce the size of the Combat Scale as Hit Points as lost. For example, if the twenty Goblins above are reduced to 2HP, they have lost over half their unit, so are now CSx4. When down to just 1HP, they are CSx3 with just 5 goblins remaining.

If the Combat Scale becomes the same for all opponents, resolve combat normally; the playing field is now level.

## Calculating Experience

Experience is gained from taking part in a battle equal to the Hit Die of the opponent, +1 for each CS higher than your own. For example, a member of the 20-strong Knights of the Rose (CSx5) will earn 3 XP after defeating an army of 35 Gnolls (a 2 Hit Die creature, CSx6).

## Mass Combat Example: Knights vs Dragon

The 500-strong Knights of the Rose stand ready against the young Dragon. They are CSx10, while the Dragon, a single creature, is just CSx1, though formidable.

500 Knights: HD2d8+4 (14HP), AC18, Lance +7 (1d10+4) or Longsword +6 (1d8+2), CSx10
Dragon: HD13×12+39 (123HP), AC21, Bite +20 (2d6+7) or Breath 10d10 DC24

The Dragon flies high above and breathes flames across their formation for 46HP damage. The knights dive for cover beneath their shields (phys+DEX to dodge DC24. They roll 25, barely making it). They take ½ damage – 23HP, divided by CSx10 for 2HP. The Knights are down to 12HP.

They ready their horses to charge as the Dragon lands, the thunder of 2,000 hooves makes the young dragon hesitate. They hit (rolled 18+7 = 25 vs. AC21), scoring 11 damage, CSx10 for a massive 110HP damage. The Dragon is down to 13HP against the small army, bleeding from the impact of many lances. It roars and lunges in anger, biting savagely. It hits easily (rolled 6+20 = 26 vs. AC18) for 17 damage, divided by 10 = 2HP. The Knights are down to 10HP. If they fall below 7HP they will be at half their numbers and down to CSx9.

They draw their Longswords and surround the downed Dragon, though their weapons do little more than scratch the drake's hide (6 + 8 = 14, a miss). The Dragon turns to bite again, and rolls a Natural 20. It's a critical, so the Knights take 19HP damage, CSx10 so 2HP lost. They are down to 8HP after watching a few more of their number be gobbled up.

Their longswords bit true (18 +6 = 24 vs. AC21), for 6HP damage, CSx10 for a total of 60HP against the drake. It's down, finally, though the Knights have lost 143 (500×4/14) of their number in the battle. They commend their souls in valor.

# Designer's Notes

### Setting the DC

The Difficulty Class can vary depending on how the player approaches the task. When setting the DC, think in terms of "What would Bob do?" - Bob being an imaginary 1st level commoner with no modifiers. Bob has straight 10s for all stats and no skill bonuses. He's the unheroic man on the street, and the benchmark by which heroes are measured.

In general, I recommend using only four DCs, especially at low levels:

| DC | Level |
| :--- | :--- |
| 10 | Easy – 50/50 chance of Bob succeeding 1st time |
| 15 | Moderate – would succeed after several attempts |
| 20 | Difficult – would succeed only with luck on his side |
| 25 | Very Difficult – Bob needs some hefty modifiers and the Titans watching over him |

Never use DC 5. If it's that easy and out of combat, keep the game flowing by having the players succeed automatically. Also, it helps if there's always an easy way to solve a problem. While each character can find at least one solution to a problem and gain the benefit of their highest attribute, there's usually a path of least resistance to be found. All the players have to do is discover it!

At higher levels, encourage the players to come up with ever more heroic solutions to problems. While a barred door might be a pause for thought to 1st level characters, by 10th level it's an excuse for light relief. Your 10th level Fighter would have a +13 Phys and most likely automatically succeed at any DC15 Phys+STR checks – so encourage them to aim for DC20, at least.

### Modifiers and More

Modifiers are the GM's Best Friend. Even a plus or minus 2 can make a world of difference, especially at lower levels. If your Human Rogue is trying to persuade the City Guard to let them enter the Merchant's Quarter after dark (Comm+MIND, DC15), grant them a +2 because the guard recently won at dice and is in a good mood. Alternatively, give them a minus 2 because he lost but drop hints as to the guard's weakness.

If the characters need to find a path through the Deadlands (Know+MIND, DC20) then finding an old trail map (a +4 modifier!) might just save them from becoming zombified minions of a powerful Lich!

Encourage the players to work for those modifiers, and reward them for clever, creative thinking. It's what the game is all about, after all.

### Fewer Skills Means More Choice

Back in the days of Classic D&D, players could do anything. With no straight-jacketed skill system to limit their choices, the players invented cool and clever solutions to problems. When faced with a 30ft. high statue with rubies for eyes, they erected pulleys to lift and swing the rogue into place far above their heads. Try doing that in 3rd Edition D&D and the GM will be left scratching their head. The D&D skill system has become a list of what the characters can do, silently eliminating all other possibilities, and that's no fun.

Microluxe20 is the best of both worlds; rather than provide a skills list, it provides a skills framework. This gives the players room to think of solutions rather than looking down a long list of skills to see what's most applicable to the task in hand.

Here's another example: Climbing. In D&D, that's a skill modified by STR. That's good if you're a Fighter, but not so good if you're a Wizard. In Microluxe20, the character could use Phys+STR ("I pull myself up"), Phys+DEX ("I nimbly climb the cliff face"), Phys+MIND ("I take my time, working out the best route and carefully testing each handhold") or even Guile+STR ("I climb, quietly"). That adds much more flavor to the game and encourages each player to find their own, unique, solution.

### Using Existing D&D Monsters

So what happens when you're running a published adventure, or using a Monster from the Monster Manual or SRD?

Simple; use them as is. It doesn't matter that the Orc makes a Listen check to see if it detects the PCs, or if the NPC fails a Spot check. The mechanics are the same (roll d20+modifiers against a DC), and the emphasis should always be on simplicity and speed of play. There's no need to convert any monsters or NPCs to Microluxe20 before you use them. Just roll, and have fun!

## Microluxe20 Monster Building

Monster Building under Microluxe20 is so fast, it's possible to do it **on the fly** , right at the game table. And I'm going to show you how, using a Ninja Monkey as an example.

First, let's start by setting the Hit Dice for our Ninja Monkeys. As these are tiny little monkeys, fighting 1st level PCs, let's give them 1HD. _Quick tip: to speed monster creation further, multiply the Hit Dice by 5 for hit points; multiply Hit Dice by 7 for Dragons and Undead._

Remember that unlike Player Characters, Monsters and other NPCs **don't** add their STR total to their hit points. This is a special bonus for Real Heroes only. If you want a tougher Monster, increase their STR so they get an increase (equal to their STR bonus) to their HP per Hit Dice.

That gives the Ninja Monkeys 1HD, 5HP, +1 to hit with their Katana and +1 with all skills. As these are intelligent Ninjas, we'll allocate their +3 to Guile. Let's give them STR 6, DEX 14 and MIND 12, allow them to use DEX (rather than STR) for their attack roll with their miniature Katanas, which do d6 damage. Factoring that in with the Hit Dice, we get:

Ninja Monkey, 1HD (3HP), AC12, +3 Katana (1d6-2)
Guile+4, all others @ +1
STR 6, DEX 14, MIND 12

DONE! If the Ninja Monkeys have any special abilities or equipment, note them down but don't bother with setting uses/day, etc; if it's dramatically appropriate for a monster to use its abilities then use them. No Rules Needed! That's the Microluxe20 way!

If you want a more powerful Ninja Monkey, just add Hit Dice, which increases HP, attack bonus and skills. Adjust Stats if it's logical to do so. Here's a 3HD Ninja Monkey:

Ninja Monkey, 3HD (12HP), AC12, +5 Katana (1d6-1)
Guile+6, all others @ +3
STR 8, DEX 14, MIND 12
