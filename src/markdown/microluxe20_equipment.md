# Equipment

When you create a character, you start with nothing but the clothes on your back and some gold in your pocket. Depending upon the setting and adventure your Gamemaster is running, you may have the opportunity to purchase some items before beginning play, or the Gamemaster may allow you to do your shopping in the game world.

These tables list a number of items, their stats, and prices for Gamemasters to populate their shops and worlds and loot tables. The availability of items in these tables is at the Gamemaster's discretion – just because it's on the list doesn't mean you can buy it at just any shop in the world.

## Starting Wealth

The most common coin used on Terador is the _gold piece_ (gp). The gold piece can be converted into other coins:

You begin with a certain amount of acquired wealth, determined by your character class.

## Weapons

Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on the table below):

- **Cost:** This value is the price for purchasing the weapon. The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon (For example, buying a bow would include a quiver as well).
- **Damage:** The damage column gives the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit.
- **Range:** Any attack less than this distance is not penalized. However, every extra 5ft. imposes a -2 penalty on the attack roll.
- **Complexity:** Different weapons require different amount of training to use. Characters with martial training can wield Complex weapons, while most spellcasters can only wield Simple weapons.

## Armor & Shields

Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on the table below):

- **Size:** The physical size of the armor. Different classes can only wear specific sizes of armor. Similar to armor sizes, different types of shields are only available to certain classes as well.
- **Cost:** The normal price of the armor.
- **AC Bonus:** The Armor Class bonus provided by the armor when worn.

## Adventuring Equipment

Characters may purchase equipment from the following lists with their starting money or select one of the standard adventuring "fast packs".

### Clothing

Characters start with some clothing, usually a Traveler's outfit. Clothes and armor are separate items – going without clothing may cause some snide looks, but going without armor will likely see you dead.

### Adventuring Gear

Characters can purchase Adventuring Gear; a catch-all assortment of odds, ends, and small, useful items. A character could use Adventuring Gear to bandage their wound with some scrap cloth, fashion a torch, start a fire with flint and steel, or scribble a set of directional markings with some chalk.

Adventuring Gear is represented by a number of uses, of which one is consumed when the Adventuring Gear is transformed into a specific item. A single use of Adventuring Gear costs 1 sp, and the specific items Adventuring Gear can create are determined by the Gamemaster.

Kits and Tools provide a +2 bonus when attempting an action where the kit is relevant; for example, when picking a lock, a character with Thieves' Tools gains a +2 bonus on their Guile + DEX check.

Characters can also purchase items of a more specific nature, a number of which are listed below.

### Mounts and Related Gear

<!-- $data gear.yml mounts -->

### Fast Equipment Packs

Suggested starting packs for new characters. Each pack uses 35gp of a character's starting money.

<!-- $data gear.yml fast-packs -->

Rogues are advised to purchase Thieves' Tools if they want to pick locks, disarm traps, etc.

### Healing Items

While potions and spells heal characters instantly, they are expensive and ineffective when used on spellcasters. More natural healing remedies are available for purchase, trading an increased healing time for utility and cost-effectiveness.

**Bandages**: Apply one per injured or bleeding limb. Each bandage heals 1d6+1 HP after an hour of rest, at which point they may be safely discarded. A bandage can be improvised from 1 use of Adventuring Gear, or purchased separately.

**Herbal Tea**: A collection of medicinal teas that restore 1d6+2 HP / hour for the next four hours of rest. Herbal tea is packaged in the dry state, and must be brewed before drinking. Drinking more than one cup of tea between rests has no effect.

**Healing Kit**: One use of a Healing Kit stablizes a downed character, immediately restores 1d6 HP, and gives them an additional 1d6+4 HP recovery / hour for the next two hours of rest. Using a healing kit again on a character who hasn't been downed or taken a long rest since the first application has no effect.
