Microluxe20 is a minimalist tabletop role-playing game designed with simplicity in mind. It is designed to be a stand-in replacement for any [SRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Reference_Document) based tabletop adventure. The main goal is to utilize the simplicity of [Microlite20](http://microlite20.net/), while also adding various races, classes, and game-balancing tweaks. It also strives to clarify some of the more confusing parts of the Microlite20 system.

# Online Handbook

To dive right into the game, check out the following online resources:

[Complete Handbook](src/markdown/microluxe20_handbook.md)

[Terador Campaign Setting](src/markdown/microluxe20_lore.md)

[Map of Terador](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microluxe20/microluxe20/master/map/Terador-complete.png)

[Races of Terador](src/markdown/microluxe20_races.md)

Microluxe20 features a pre-designed campaign setting, named "Terador" for ease-of-use. However, because of the simplicity of the rules, custom and homebrew campaign settings are very easy to implement. Definitely feel free to use your own setting, races, and other homebrew content!
